Try running on the spot really fast and then running on the spot really slowly. \n\nCan you make learning about shapes fun?

It could be the clouds, the sky, birds, a candle or a spot on the roof\n\nAs you quieten your eyes, notice your thoughts. What are you thinking about? Are you thinking about the past or the future? Are your thoughts positive or negative? \n\nNotice your breath coming in and out of your nose. As you breath out imagine your thoughts floating away with your breath. Just let them go. \n\nDo this for a couple of breaths.\n\nNow let your eyes move slowly around again. How do you feel now?\n\nQuietening your eyes can help quieten your mind and bring a sense of inner peace. Did you feel it?\n"

It doesn't have to be big. \n\nAnd wrap your arms around your body and give yourself a hug.\n\nAnd now think of one thing you did today that you don't feel proud of. What can you do differently tomorrow? \n\nAnd wrap your arms around your body and give yourself a hug!\n\nYou're doing your best so be kind to yourself! A practice of self compassion can help us feel calm and cope better."
