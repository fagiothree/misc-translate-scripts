    "text": "Hello! How are you doing? Today’s tip is about spending One-on-One Time with our children.\nIt’s free and fun. It makes children feel loved and secure, and also increases their confidence and self-esteem!\nHere are 6 tips to make it a success:\nStep 1. Spend at least 5 minutes with each child\nEven 5 minutes a day of quality time makes a big difference. It can be at the same time each day so your children look forward to it.\nStep 2. Give your child your full attention\nMake sure you will not be interrupted. Switch off the TV and give your full attention to your child while setting aside other things for now. Put your phone on silent. It will show your child, they are important.\nStep 3. Let your child choose the activity\nAsk your child what they would like to do. You can say, \"I have 5 minutes to spend One-on-One Time with you, what would you like to do?”\nChoosing builds their self-confidence. If they want to do something that isn’t OK with COVID-19 rules, then this is a chance to talk with them about this. If your child cannot think of anything, you can give them a choice of a couple things that you know they like, like reading a book or building blocks together.\nStep 4. Follow your child's lead\nChildren need to do things in their own time. Try to give them time to explore and be patient. Play alongside and copy what they are doing but try to let them keep the initiative.\nStep 5. Use words to describe what your child is doing\nListening to your child is more important than talking to them at this time. If you do talk you should describe what your child is doing. Use words to describe actions, colours, shapes, numbers, sizes, textures, temperatures, tastes, sounds, and anything else that is happening!\nStep 6. Have fun!\nOne-on-One Time with your child can be fun for you, too! You might even find that you feel less stressed after playing with your child.\nCongratulations! You have added another skill to your Parenting Toolkit. Quality time with your children is the best gift that you can ever give them.",

    "text": "Hi! I just wanted to thank you for making this commitment to improve the life of your children. It shows you really care!\nToday's Parenting Tip is all about Praise. We all appreciate it when the good things we do are recognised by others, especially when it is someone who is close to us.\nPraise works for our children, too.

Praise your child or teenager for something they have done well. They may not show it, but you’ll see them doing that good thing again. It will also reassure them that you notice and care.\nStep 2. Praise the behaviour. Use words to describe the behaviour that you are praising. Say, 'Well done for finishing all your chores, Sam,' instead of 'Good job.'\nStep 3. Praise with enthusiasm. Really mean it when you say it!\nWell done for adding another skill to your Parenting Toolkit! Try to find 3 things that you can praise your children for every day.

    "text": "Hello! Most parents struggle when their children have temper tantrums and other demanding behaviours.\nHere are 6 steps, you can try to make it happen less often!\n1. Try to redirect your child's attention\nWhen they start demanding or whining, first try to redirect them to a positive behaviour or activity and praise them!\n2. Make sure it is a behaviour you can ignore\nIgnore negative attention seeking and demanding behaviours, like whining, demanding, showing off, and tantrums. If we respond or give in to these behaviours, children learn that this will get them attention and what they want.\n3. Ignore the behaviour not your child.\nIgnoring means removing physical and verbal attention. Take a Pause, stay calm, and be aware of what your child is doing.\n4. Praise your child immediately for the next positive behaviour\nHaving a tantrum is difficult for your child too. As soon as your child has calmed down, involve them in a positive activity. You can talk about what happened later, but right now your child needs love.\n5. Be consistent when ignoring\nYour child’s response might get worse when you first start using ignore. They are trying to test you! Continue to ignore the behaviour!\nOver time, your child will learn that it no longer works.\n6. Make sure you are giving your child plenty of positive attention at other times\nIf you find yourself ignoring your child's behaviour a lot, you are not being consistent (sometimes ignoring and sometimes giving in) OR you are not spending enough positive time with your child. One-on-One Time is super important!\nWell done! You have added another skill to your Parenting Toolkit.\nIgnoring negative attention seeking and demanding behaviours is not easy. But if you are patient, it really works. You can do this!",
