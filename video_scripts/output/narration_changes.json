    "text": "Hi! I just wanted to thank you for making this commitment to improve the life of your children. It shows you really care!\nToday's Parenting Tip is all about Praise.\nWe all appreciate it when the good things we do are recognised by others, especially when it is someone who is close to us.\nPraise works for our children, too. When you bring more attention to positive behaviour, they are likely to do it more often. They also will feel good about themselves!\nHere are 3 simple steps to get it right:\nStep 1. Praise your child or teenager for something they have done well. They may not show it, but youâ€™ll see them doing that good thing again. It will also reassure them that you notice and care.\nStep 2. Praise the behaviour. Use words to describe the behaviour that you are praising. Say, 'Well done for finishing all your chores, Sam,' instead of 'Good job.'\nStep 3. Praise with enthusiasm. Really mean it when you say it!\nWell done for adding another skill to your Parenting Toolkit! Try to find 3 things that you can praise your children for every day. You can also praise other adults in your household, too. Notice how they respond!",
