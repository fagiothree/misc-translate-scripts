Today’s tip is about spending One-on-One Time with our babies.\nThis builds a healthy attachment that will make them feel secure and loved.\nIt is normal to struggle to think of what to do with our babies.\nHere are 7 easy tips to make it a success:\nStep 1. Do it every day!\nTry to spend time playing with your baby every day, at a time when you are not distracted by others, your television or phone.\nStep 2. Be close to your child.\nSkin-to-skin contact is especially important for new-borns and infants. For older toddlers, make sure you are at the same level as they are.\nStep 3. Let your baby take the lead\nGive them time to explore things in their own way and pace. Be patient and reassuring - the world is brand new to your child!\nStep 4. Observe your child.\nSee what your child is interested in or looking at. Notice their sounds, words and facial expressions, and try copying them!\nStep 5. Play with your baby\nBabies learn through play! Help your child explore the world through their five senses. It is okay for your child’s attention to wander to many different things. Just keep your attention on your child.\nStep 6. Talk to your baby\nStart talking to your baby from the moment they are born. Did you know your baby can even recognise their name at a very early age? Try saying your baby's name and notice how they respond!\nUse words to describe everything around you: your child’s actions, colours, shapes, numbers, sizes, textures, temperatures, tastes, sounds.\nStep 7. You can have quality time with your baby anytime!\nConnect with your baby playfully during feeding, bathing, and dressing, or calmly at bedtime.\nCongratulations! You have added another skill to your Parenting Toolkit. Quality time with your children is the best gift that you can ever give them.",

It makes children feel loved and secure, and also increases their confidence and self-esteem!\nHere are 6 tips to make it a success:\nStep 1. Spend at least 5 minutes with each child\nEven 5 minutes a day of quality time makes a big difference. It can be at the same time each day so your children look forward to it.\nStep 2. Give your child your full attention\nMake sure you will not be interrupted. Switch off the TV and put your phone on silent. It will show your child, they are important.\nStep 3. Let your child choose the activity\nAsk your child what they would like to do. You can say, \"I have 5 minutes to spend One-on-One Time with you, what would you like to do?”\nChoosing builds their self-confidence. If they want to do something that isn’t OK with COVID-19 rules, then this is a chance to talk with them about this. If your child cannot think of anything, you can give them a choice of a couple things that you know they like.\nStep 4. Follow your child's lead\nChildren need to do things in their own time. Try to give them time to explore and be patient. Play alongside and copy what they are doing but try to let them keep the initiative.\nStep 5. Use words to describe what your child is doing\nListening to your child is more important than talking to them at this time. If you do talk you should describe what your child is doing. Use words to describe actions, colours, shapes, numbers, sizes, textures, temperatures, tastes, sounds, and anything else that is happening!\nStep 6. Have fun!\nOne-on-One Time with your child can be fun for you, too! You might even find that you feel less stressed after playing with your child.\nCongratulations!

Get Your Child's Attention\nLook at your child and say their name when you give your child an instruction. Get down to their level.\nStep 2. Be Specific, Positive, and Realistic!\nDescribe exactly what you want your child to do. Say, 'Please wash your hands for 20 seconds before coming to dinner, instead of 'Wash your hands.'\nUse positive words when telling your child what to do. Say, ‘Please put your clothes away in the cupboard,’ instead of ‘Don’t make a mess’.\nCan your child actually do what you are asking them?

Give your child a choice to follow your instruction before giving them the consequence.\n2. Try to stay calm but firm when giving the consequence.\nIf you start yelling, it will just make things worse. Take a deep breath before responding.\n3.

Consequences for breaking rules\nConsequences can also be used when your children forget a household rule.\nFor example: “Either you do your schoolwork before dinner, or you cannot watch your favourite T.V. show tonight.”.\nIn summary, consequences should be...\n1. Realistic: Consider the age of your child\n2. Immediate: Give them as soon as possible\n3. Fair: Make sure the consequence is not too harsh\n4.

Use a lively voice\nThis will help to keep the child’s attention on the book.\n3. Point, name and repeat\nPointing to and naming an object or person in the book will help your child learn new words. Children learn through repetition, so look for other opportunities to use that word.\n4. Be positive and supportive\nAlways respond positively to what your child says:  If your child points to a red apple and says “Tomato”, you can say “Yes, you’re right, it’s red - it's an apple!”\n5. Making actions and links\nConnect things in the book with things your child knows. If someone in the book is waving, you and your child can do the same.\n6. Talking about feelings\nUse what is happening in the book to help your child understand emotion words (happy, sad, angry, scared). Use your face and voice. Talk about your child’s own feelings, and why other people might feel a certain way:\n“Look, she is smiling. Why do you think she is smiling? What made you smile today?”\n7.

Ignore the behaviour not your child.\nIgnoring means removing physical and verbal attention. Take a Pause, stay calm, and be aware of what your child is doing.\n4. Praise your child immediately for the next positive behaviour\nHaving a tantrum is difficult for your child too. As soon as your child has calmed down, involve themin a positive activity.

It is one of the main ways a baby can tell you that something is wrong.\nHere are some tips that might help when your baby cries:\n1. Why do babies cry?\nCrying is part of your baby's development. Crying usually increases when your baby is  2-3 weeks old,  is generally highest when your baby is around 6 to 8 weeks, and often reduces around 3 to 4 months. Every baby is different!\n2. Respond as soon as you can\nGo to your baby when you hear them crying. Babies who are carried and cuddled frequently, during both fussy and contented periods, may actually cry less.\n3.  Check to see why your baby is crying\nIt might be hunger, pain, too much going on, rough handling, feeling cold/hot, wanting contact or attention, or feeling irritable. Babies can cry when they sense tension in the room, or sometimes for no reason at all!\n4. Comfort your baby\nTry swaddling, gently rocking, or singing softly. You might need to feed your baby, change their diaper, make them feel warmer or cooler or just hold them\n5. Take a break!\nTake a Pause and try to relax. If you are getting angry because your baby won’t stop crying, you can leave them on their back in a safe place for a bit. Check on your baby every 5-10 minutes.\nIf you feel overwhelmed, ask someone for help - that is a sign of strength.\n6. Be gentle and patient with yourself\nYou are not a bad parent if your baby continues to cry. You are doing your best!\n7. If you think your baby is injured or sick, call or visit a clinic\nIf your baby cries non-stop for a long time, seek medical help immediately.\nWell done!

Listen to your children when they share, accept how they feel, and give them comfort.\n2. Share your own feelings\nThis will help your children recognise, understand and manage their own feelings too.\n3. Help your child learn how to talk about feelings\nThere are 6 basic emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgusted, Surprised, and Afraid. Even babies can feel and express these emotions. As children get older, they learn to identify many other emotions, like excited, frustrated, proud, lonely, peaceful, guilty, or confused.\n4. Talking about difficult emotions\nIt is difficult for many people to talk about and express emotions and feelings. Especially for boys and men who were told not to cry when sad or laugh when happy. .\nBut we all have feelings and emotions. We can learn how to become aware of them, experience them in our body, and communicate about them. This can help children manage anger, disappointment, and frustration.\n5. Notice the positive emotions\nTalking about feelings can also help your child be more aware of positive emotions (such as a sense of peace, happiness, or calmness), and appreciate a beautiful moment or feeling of love!\n6. Show your child that you care\nUse physical and verbal support to make your child feel accepted and loved. A hug or saying, \"I understand,\" can mean a lot.

The more we practice modeling peaceful, loving relationships for our children, the more secure and loved they will feel.\n2. Use positive language. It works!\nTell others what you want them to do instead of what you don’t want them to do: Instead of “Stop shouting,” try “Please speak more quietly”\nPraise others to make them feel appreciated. Saying “Thank you for clearing the dinner” can make a big difference.\n3. Be a great listener\nListen to others when they are talking with you. Be open and show them that you hear what they are saying. It can help to summarise what you have heard before responding: “What I hear you saying is…”\n4. Share the load\nLooking after children and other family members is difficult, but it’s much easier when responsibilities are shared. Try to share household chores, childcare, and other tasks equally amongst family members\n5. Take care of yourself\nCreate a schedule for time “on” and time “off” with other adults in your household. It is okay to ask for help when you are feeling tired or stressed.\nWhen you see arguments building up, agree to take a break and go into another room or outside if you can.\n6.

What do we spend on now?\n• Get a piece of paper or cardboard and a pen.\n• Draw pictures of all the things that you and your family spend money on each month.\n• Write next to each picture how much each thing costs.\n• Add up how much money you have to spend each month.\n2. Talk about needs and wants\n• Needs: Which things are important or must haves for your family to survive? (like food, soap to wash hands, needs for ill or disabled family members).\n• Wants: Which things are nice to have but not essential?\nDiscuss with your children where you can spend less as a family.\n3. Build your own budget\n• Find some stones or small objects. This is your money for the month.\n• As a family, decide what you will spend on what, and put the stones on your picture.\n• If you can save even a tiny amount for the future or an emergency  – it can make a big difference over time.\n4. Find out where you can get extra help\nYour government or community groups may be giving money, or food parcels to families during COVID-19.\nWell done for adding another tool to your Parenting Toolkit!

Be open, honest, and supportive\nAllow your child to talk freely. Ask them open questions and find out how much they already know.\nAlways answer their questions truthfully.

Be a hero not a bully\nExplain that COVID-19 has nothing to do with the way someone looks, where they are from, or what language they speak.\nTell your child that we can be compassionate to people who are sick and those who are caring for them.\nStep 4.

It is normal to feel overwhelmed when we have to help our children learn, especially when we also have stress about work and money.\nHere are 5 steps that you can do to help your children continue learning during this time:\nStep 1.

Stay connected with your child's school and teachers\nFind out how to stay in touch with your children’s teacher or school to stay informed, ask questions and get more guidance. If you are struggling or know someone who is struggling with school work or the home situation, please discuss this with a teacher that you feel close to. Parent groups or community groups can also be a good way to support each other with your home schooling.\nStep 5. Support your child when they go back to school\nTell your child that it is okay to feel scared or worried about going back to school. Allow your child to share how they are feeling. It is also normal if your child behaves differently to their usual behaviour. Discuss how going to school might be different and how they can protect themselves from COVID-19.
