Go to this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dEycCWtlnw_7pjkmbH3kSo96fAhEN5H7QI_2ieYDO94/edit?usp=sharing

Save the Google Doc as a TXT file called input.txt and put it in the input folder of this repository.

If a new title (topic) gets added to the input.txt you have to add that title to the list of titles in narration_translate_script1.ts

Run ```yarn install``` to install packages needed to run the script
Run ```npm run narration-from-txt``` to extract the voiceover text from the txt file and put it into JSON files in the output folder.

The narration_list.json file in the output folder is the one that needs to be uploaded to https://idems-media-recorder.web.app/ 
Uploading to the IDEMS media recorder currently requires manually removing things from a Firebase database. Please contact David Stern or Chris Clarke for this.
